        <h2>Introduction to Global Warming</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>i. Definition</h3>
            <p><i>Global warming</i> refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to <i>human activities</i>, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases. The Earth's climate is influenced by various factors, including the presence of certain gases in the atmosphere that trap heat.<br>
			<br>The most common greenhouse gas is <b><a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" target="_blank">carbon dioxide (CO2)</a></b>, but others include <b><a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane" target="_blank">methane (CH4)</a></b>, <b><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide" target="_blank">nitrous oxide (N2O)</a></b>, and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorinated_gases" target="_blank">fluorinated gases</a></i>. These gases create a <b>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect">greenhouse effect</a>"</b> by trapping infrared radiation from the sun, preventing it from escaping back into space. As a result, the Earth's surface and atmosphere warm up.</p>
        </article>
		<br>
        <article>
            <h3>ii. Difference Between Global Warming and Climate Change</h3>
            <p><ol><li><b><i>Definition:</i></b><br>

<b>Global Warming:</b> It specifically refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature, primarily due to human activities that result in the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The focus is on the warming of the planet.
<br><b>Climate Change:</b> It is a broader term that encompasses a range of long-term changes in climate patterns, including temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and more. Climate change includes variations in climate conditions at regional and global scales.</li>

<li><b><i>Time Scale:</i></b><br>

<b>Global Warming:</b> Typically emphasizes temperature changes over a specific period, often decades to centuries.
<br><b>Climate Change:</b> Refers to long-term changes in climate patterns, encompassing both natural variations and human-induced alterations over extended periods, typically spanning centuries.</li>

<li><b><i>Causation:</i></b><br>

<b>Global Warming:</b> Primarily attributed to the enhanced greenhouse effect caused by the increase in human-made greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane.<br>
<b>Climate Change:</b> Arises from a combination of natural factors (volcanic activity, solar radiation variability) and human activities (greenhouse gas emissions, land use changes, deforestation).

    <section id="causes">
        <h2>Causes of Global Warming</h2>
        <!-- Add content for causes section -->
		<p> The primary causes of global warming are human activities that contribute to the increase in greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. These activities enhance the natural greenhouse effect, trapping more heat and leading to a rise in the planet's average surface temperature.<br> The main causes include:</p>
		<ol>
		<li><b><i>Burning of Fossil Fuels:</i></b>

Combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas for energy releases large amounts of <i>carbon dioxide (CO2)</i> into the atmosphere.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<b><i>Deforestation:</i></b>

Clearing of forests reduces the number of trees available to absorb CO2 through <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis" target="_blank">photosynthesis</a></i>, contributing to increased greenhouse gas concentrations.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<b><i>Agricultural Practices:</i></b>

<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock" target="_blank">Livestock farming</a></i> produces methane through <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteric_fermentation" target="_blank">enteric fermentation</a></i> in the digestive systems of animals, and rice paddies emit methane during cultivation.
		</li>
		
		<li><b><i>Industrial Activities:</i></b>

Certain industrial processes, such as <b>cement production</b> and <b>chemical manufacturing</b>, release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<b><i>Waste Management:</i></b>

Decomposition of organic waste in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill" target="_blank">landfills</a></i> produces methane, and improper waste disposal practices contribute to increased greenhouse gas emissions.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<b><i>Use of Synthetic Chemicals:</i></b>

Certain industrial processes and the use of <b>synthetic chemicals</b> release <i><a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorinated_gases" target="_blank">fluorinated gases</a></i>, which have high global warming potentials.

<h2>Wildlife and Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Global warming is intricately reshaping the world's wildlife and ecosystems. As temperatures rise, species face adaptation challenges, with habitat shifts becoming prevalent. 
Coastal ecosystems are particularly vulnerable due to rising sea levels, jeopardizing breeding and feeding grounds. 
Ocean acidification threatens marine life, impacting species with calcium carbonate structures.
 More frequent extreme weather events cause habitat destruction and food source shortages. 
 Changes in precipitation patterns affect <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater_ecosystem" target=""_blank>freshwater ecosystems</a></i> and their inhabitants. 
The intricate balance of species interactions is under threat, heightening the risk of biodiversity loss. 
Global cooperation is crucial to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, implement targeted conservation measures, and develop adaptive strategies to protect vulnerable wildlife and ecosystems.</p>

<p><b>Here are some ways in which global warming affects wildlife and ecosystems:</b></p>

<ol>
<li><b>Temperature Changes:</b><br>
<ul type="disc">
<b><li>Impact on Species:</b> Many species have specific temperature ranges they can tolerate. 
Global warming can alter these temperature ranges, affecting the distribution and behavior of species. 
Some may struggle to adapt or <i>migrate</i> to suitable habitats, leading to shifts in ecosystems.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<b>Habitat Loss and Fragmentation:</b><br>
<ul type="disc">
<b><li>Rising Sea Levels:</b> Global warming contributes to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, leading to rising sea levels. Coastal habitats, critical for numerous species, can be submerged or lost.</li>
<b><li>Changes in Vegetation:</b> Altered temperature and precipitation patterns can lead to shifts in vegetation zones, affecting habitats for both plant and animal species.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<b>Shifts in Migration and Breeding Patterns:</b><br>
<ul type="disc"><li>
<b>Timing Discrepancies:</b> Changes in temperature can cause mismatches between the timing of migration, 
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeding" target="_blank">breeding</a></i>, and the availability of food resources. 
This can disrupt ecosystem's delicate balance.</li></ul></li>

<li>
<b>Ocean Acidification:</b><br>
<ul type="disc"><li>
<b>Impact on Marine Life:</b> Increased absorption of carbon dioxide by the oceans contributes to ocean acidification. 
This can harm marine life, 
particularly organisms with calcium carbonate shells or <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton" target="_blank">skeletons</a></i>, such as coral reefs and some shellfish.</li></ul>
</li>

<li><b>Extreme Weather Events:</b><br>
<ul type="disc"><li>
<b>Disruption of Ecosystems:</b> More frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires,

affecting species like <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear">polar bears</a></i> that rely on sea ice for hunting and breeding.</li></ul></li>

<li>
<b>Loss of Biodiversity:</b><br>
<ul type="disc"><li>
<b>Species Extinctions:</b> The combined effects of habitat loss, temperature changes,
